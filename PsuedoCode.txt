    if it is a knight check proper coordinates
    if it is a pawn check for proper coordinates and incorporate the forward diagnomal strike move
        for pawn check if it has reached the end of the board : 
              if yes -> ask player to upgrade to pawn :
                if yes then set playtype to UpgradePawn 
                     check if pawn can be upgraded (if there are less then 2 knights). If not then ask the player to reposition pawn to a valid place
